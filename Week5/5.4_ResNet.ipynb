    "\n",
    "As we design increasingly deeper networks it becomes imperative to understand how adding layers can increase the complexity and expressiveness of the network.\n",
    "Even more important is the ability to design networks where adding layers makes networks strictly more expressive rather than just different.\n",
    "To make some progress we need a bit of mathematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider $\\mathcal{F}$, the class of functions that a specific network architecture (together with learning rates and other hyperparameter settings) can reach.\n",
    "That is, for all $f \\in \\mathcal{F}$ there exists some set of parameters (e.g., weights and biases) that can be obtained through training on a suitable dataset.\n",
    "Let us assume that $f^*$ is the \"truth\" function that we really would like to find.\n",
    "If it is in $\\mathcal{F}$, we are in good shape but typically we will not be quite so lucky.\n",
    "Instead, we will try to find some $f^*_\\mathcal{F}$ which is our best bet within $\\mathcal{F}$.\n",
    "For instance, \n",
    "given a dataset with features $\\mathbf{X}$\n",
    "and labels $\\mathbf{y}$,\n",
    "we might try finding it by solving the following optimization problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f^*_\\mathcal{F} \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=} \\mathop{\\mathrm{argmin}}_f L(\\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{y}, f) \\text{ subject to } f \\in \\mathcal{F}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is only reasonable to assume that if we design a different and more powerful architecture $\\mathcal{F}'$ we should arrive at a better outcome. In other words, we would expect that $f^*_{\\mathcal{F}'}$ is \"better\" than $f^*_{\\mathcal{F}}$. However, if $\\mathcal{F} \\not\\subseteq \\mathcal{F}'$ there is no guarantee that this should even happen. In fact, $f^*_{\\mathcal{F}'}$ might well be worse. \n",
    "As illustrated by :numref:`fig_functionclasses`,\n",

    "on the left of :numref:`fig_functionclasses`,\n",
    "though $\\mathcal{F}_3$ is closer to $f^*$ than $\\mathcal{F}_1$, $\\mathcal{F}_6$ moves away and there is no guarantee that further increasing the complexity can reduce the distance from $f^*$.\n",
    "With nested function classes\n",
    "where $\\mathcal{F}_1 \\subseteq \\ldots \\subseteq \\mathcal{F}_6$\n",
