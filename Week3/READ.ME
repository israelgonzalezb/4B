This week we took a look at unsupervised learning methods including clustering (k-means, DBSCAN, t-SNE), dimensionality reduction (PCA), anomoly detection, and recommender systems.  There were two offline assignments, a live assignment including an instructor lead section on Tensorboard, and an extra credit section in which we ran both DBSCAN and t-SNE on the dataset on our own.
